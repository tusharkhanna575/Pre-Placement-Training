## Question - I
### Given three integer arrays `arr1`, `arr2` and `arr3` sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.

**Example :**
```
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.

## Question - II
### Given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list answer of size 2 where:
- `answer[0]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are not present in `nums2`.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are not present in `nums1`.

Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

**Example :**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation: For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].
